          When monkey was 20 years old the Khmer rouge took power in Cambodia.
          The regime of Pol Pot sent away all people in Phnom Penh to the countryside where they 
          were left to fend for themself. It was during this time Monkey went back to her parents home country 
          of Vietnam. Back in Vietnam she got a job as a chef at a restaurant in Saigon, there in the kitchen, she thrived.
          She had finally found what would become her passion in life, cooking!</div><br>
          
          After working for over 40 years in restaurants all over Vietnam she knows her way around the kitchen.
          Nowadays she is passing all her knowledge and cooking skills to the younger generation of the family.

<div id="about">
  <div class="contatiner-fluid">
    <h3 class="fancy">Established in 1991</h3><br>
    <div>
  After working for years in different Vietnamese kitchens Monkey eventually moved
to Norway to stay with her daughter who studied here. Almost immediately she wanted back to the kitchen.
As there were no Vietnamese restaurants in Stavanger at that time she decided the only option was to create one herself
. </div><br>
  
 In 1990 just three weeks before the grand opening, disaster struck. The neighbor's house caught fire and it spread over to the restaurant.
 The restaurant was damaged beyond repair, however, Monkey did not give up. She collected the few belongings not affected by the fire
 and was determined to try again. One year would pass before she could finally open again in a new location.
 Then finally in 1991, the restaurant as we know it today had its first year, the focus on homegrown vegetables,
 locally produced products and farm-bought meat all helped in giving the food the taste we know today. 
</div><br>

<div>
  Still to this day the values that Monkey restaurant had from the beginning are still very much intact.
  We still strive to make good food and make the customers happy. We still buy all of our meat, fish and vegetables
  from local fishermen, farmers and butcher shops.
 Quality is engrained in all aspects and happy customers always come back. Please come and eat with us.
